aboutlabel1=I made phyton for one reason. To help.
aboutlabel2=I realise that many people don't find physics easy, as per se. However, that doesn't mean I can't help you with that.
aboutlabel3=With phyton, I try to integrate simulations that can help anyone understand electrical circuits, based entirely on the circuit diagrams that most physicists are so familiar with.
aboutlabel4=This app was made during Covid-19, and strives to allow hands-on learning of electricity without having to go to the lab.
aboutMelabel1=Hi,
aboutMelabel2=My name is Prannaya Gupta,
aboutMelabel3=and I am a student in NUS High.
aboutCelllabel2=A cell is usually initiated with 1.5 V of emf. This is generally the normal EMF of a cell.
aboutCelllabel3=Multiple cells can be joined together to form an ideal battery. An ideal battery is such that it has no effective resistance, thus if such a cell is joined together with a simple wire, an infinite current will ideally be generated.
aboutCelllabel4=You can also change the EMF by simply going to the side panel and editing the EMF. You can either represent it in the form "n V", where n is the number of volts you want, or with "n kgm^2/As^3", which is the SI unit form of voltage. You can also simply enter "n" and the press enter and this will register it as "n V".

aboutBulblabel2=A bulb is initiated with 1 ohm of resistance. While this is not generally the normal resistance of a bulb, a bulb is known to have varying resistances. Thus, it was simplified to 1 ohm.
aboutBulblabel3=The bulb can be connected in series with a cell to generate a current, GIVEN that the circuit is closed.
aboutBulblabel4=You can change the resistance by simply going to the side panel and editing the R property. You can either represent it in the form "n 立", where n is the number of ohms you want to set the bulb with, or with "n kgm^2/s^3A^2", which is the SI unit form of ohms. You can also simply enter "n" and the press enter and this will register it as "n 立".
aboutResistorlabel2=A resistor is initiated with 1 ohm of resistance. While this is not generally the normal resistance of a resistor, a resistor is known to be very variable, if you get what I mean. Thus, it was simplified to 1 ohm.
